# <center>Systematizing Systematization of Knowledge</center>

Since 2010, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland"
conference) has included papers on _Systematization of Knowledge_
(SoK).  This paper track grew out of discussions at the <a
href="http://sos.cs.virginia.edu"><em>NSF/IARPA/NSA Workshop on the
Science of Security</em></a> held at the Claremont Resort in November
2008.

This site collects (and attempts to systematize!) all the Oakland SoK
papers.
